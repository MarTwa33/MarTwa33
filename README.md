# About me

My name is Marcin Twaróg. I graduated in Civil Engineering from the Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza and Politechnika Krakowska. I've started to have interest in software testing since december 2021. I began to build my technical background to be a professional software tester soon. During my current job, I have a lots of opportunities to develop my skills in time management and problem resolving. In my free time I learned a lot about software testing.  Please see my examples below. My goal is to be a professional automated software tester, but I'm aware of the path I have to follow and I don't want to miss the opportunity to became a manual software tester. I'm still polishing my english and I have regular meetings with a native speaker.

# Facts based on my experience so far
